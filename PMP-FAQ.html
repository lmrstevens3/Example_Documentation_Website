                    "a": "Yes! Data harmonization looks at how data is represented in a dataset to find commonly used variables and then reassigns those variables to a ‘more common’ label.  The goal of harmonization is to make more datasets interoperable and available for researchers.  " +
                        "An example of this is how a person’s sex could be listed as Male or Female or M and F, however the ‘more common’ label for a person’s sex is Male and Female.  If the dataset uses M and F as the labels, the data harmonization process would change these to Male and Female and then make note of the change.  " +
