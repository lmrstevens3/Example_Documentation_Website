    "\n",
    "## In-form Quality Checks\n",
    "There are in-form data quality checks to ensure accurate data entry, flagging and preventing records from saving when a value is not within expected range. For example:\n",
    "* Records can not be saved if a categorical variable (ex. Race) has a value entered that is not in the pre-defined variable configurations. \n",
    "* Records can not be saved if a continuous variable (ex. white blood cell count) has a value entered that is outside the pre-defined range for that variable.\n",

    "## Post Collection Quality Checks and Exclusions\n",
    "In an effort to provide as much data to investigators as possible, we did **NOT** exclude records that are incomplete, instead opting to include records that have critical dates, demographic and comorbidity data available. Additional, analysis specific, quality checks are should be assessed and completed upon performing analyses. As a **minimum data quality check, the following records have been Excluded from the analytic data set:**\n",
