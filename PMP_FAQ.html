                "q": "Why am I not able to use the AWS Marketplace as I do with my university AWS infrastructure?",
                "a": "The PMP is built using Hadoop and Jupyter framework as an easier transition to move to the cloud. Because of the design and security decisions, not all the offerings on AWS Marketplace are available within the workspace. "
            },
            {
                "q": "Can I use SAS or other licensed products in conjunction with the PMP?",
                "a": "Yes, however, you must have an active license for the tool prior to loading it on the platform.  Go to Technical Support for assistance loading tools; when completing the form, include details of the type of software you want to upload onto your workspace, including your active license."

                "q": "I know nothing about Jupyter Notebooks.  Do you provide training on how to use the notebooks?",

                    "a": "Yes! Data harmonization looks at how data is represented in a dataset to find commonly used variables and then reassigns those variables to a ‘more common’ label.  The goal of harmonization is to make more datasets interoperable and available for researchers.  " +
                        "An example of this is how a person’s sex could be listed as Male or Female or M and F, however the ‘more common’ label for a person’s sex is Male and Female.  If the dataset uses M and F as the labels, the data harmonization process would change these to Male and Female and then make note of the change.  " +
                        "By harmonizing the data within datasets, researchers can pull data from multiple datasets and be confident that the terms used to label variables and the variables themselves are consistent across datasets.   "

                    "a":"The cloud is a network of remote servers hosted on the internet and used to store, manage, and process data in place of local servers and personal computers. " +
                        "This technology allows us to work on large, complex datasets in a much faster time span than was previously possible with conventional computing."

                        "The PMP uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) to provide its users an on-demand secure cloud services platform " +
                        "– a virtual cluster of computers – offering compute power, database storage, content delivery and other functionality to help institutions scale and grow their research exponentially faster than they might on their own.  " +
                        "This provides users access to large-scale computing capacity quickly and inexpensively without the need to schedule or coordinate access as one might at an institution."

                    "q":"Why isn’t the PMP on the list of approved repositories for the AHA Open Science Policy?",
                    "a":"Not only do you need to register as a user of the PMP to gain access to data, some of the PMP datasets require approval for use/access, hence, the PMP does not meet the guidelines of an ‘Open Data’ repository where everyone has access to the data.  "
